# Conway's Game of Life with React

Conway's Game of Life is a famous cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from the players. 

## Rules of the Game

The game takes place on a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two possible states: *alive* or *dead*. The grid evolves over time according to a set of rules based on the state of each cell and its neighbors. The rules are as follows:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to create a visual representation of the game using React. With this project, users can interact with the grid by clicking on specific cells to make them alive or dead, change the grid size, and watch the simulation as it progresses according to the game's rules.

## Features

- Interactive and responsive game grid
- Ability to click on specific cells to make them alive or dead
- Change the grid size to fit your needs
- Watch the simulation as it progresses according to the game's rules
